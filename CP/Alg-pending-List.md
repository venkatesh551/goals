I see coding competitions as an efficient and fun learning tool for  
algorithms/data structures/discrete math/coding/debugging. 
After a while you get diminishing returns. When you see that switch to something else.


Communication skills: Communicating clearly is a skill and it has to be trained. University or coding contests don't put much emphasis on it.

(clarity) I had a hard time explaining my solutions clearly to other people during high school and first two years of university. I got much better when I started coaching kids for coding contests and writing articles about algorithms in a romanian publication. 

(English proficiency)  People with English as their second language might find it difficult to explain complex technical issues. (and a thick eastern european accent definitely doesn't help :) ).

(introversion) Someone who's introverted might find it hard to verbalize his though process.




I think problems find people and people find problems. 
Depending of your interest (algorithms, distributed systems, 
natural language processing, machine learning, programming 
language design, compilers, low level programming, front end development, etc) 
you can find plenty of problems to tackle at Google. So it depends on you, 
not on Google if you use your knowledge or not.

MergeSort:
*************

Lower bound for sorting a Young tableaux.  (sedgewick)
 O(n^2 logn) for n*n

1. Merging two arrays of different lengths. Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] of sizes M and N where M â‰¥ N, devise an algorithm to merge them into a new sorted array c[] using ~ N lg M compares.
Hint: use binary search.
Note: there is a lower bound of Omega(N log (1 + M/N)) compares. This follows because there are M+N choose N possible merged outcomes. A decision tree argument shows that this requires at least lg (M+N choose N) compares. We note that n choose r >= (n/r)^r.

2. Merging three arrays. Given three sorted arrays a[], b[], and c[], each of size N, design an algorithm to merge them into a new sorted array d[] using at most ~ 6 N compares in the worst case (or, even better, ~ 5 N compares).

3. Merging three arrays. Given three sorted arrays a[], b[], and c[], each of size N, prove that no compare-based algorithm can merge them into a new sorted array d[] using fewer than ~ 4.754887503 N compares in the worst case.

4. Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort alg

* 5. Implementation is pending for 

 k-near-sorting. Suppose you have an array a[] of N distinct items which is nearly sorted: each item at most k positions away from its position in the sorted order. Design an algorithm to sort the array in time proportional to N log k.

Lower bound is the best case running time. Lower bound is determined by the easiest input. It provides a goal for all inputs. 
Where as upper bound  is the worst case and is determined by the  most difficult input for a given algorithm.
Upper bounds provide guarantees for all inputs ie.. guarantees on performance of the algorithm when run on different inputs will not perform any worse than over the most difficult input.


big omega is lowerbound 

O-notation is upperbound
