I would disconnect from the Internet for a few months and move alone to a cabin 

ream = 500 sheets of paper

with a ream of paper, a couple boxes of pencils, TAOCP, a few supplementary math books

No laptop, no wifi, no electricity — these are all distractions.


"If you think you're a really good programmer... read (Knuth's) Art of Computer Programming... 
You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing," 
said a quote from Bill Gates on the cover of the third edition of the first volume.


"It took incredible discipline, and several months, for me to read it. 
I studied 20 pages, put it away for a week, and came back for another 20 pages.
If somebody is so brash that they think they know everything, 
Knuth will help them understand that the world is deep and complicated."

Knuth's work has become the stuff of tech industry legend - a rite of passage 
for any programmer who wants to go beyond mere coding and deeper 
into the underlying complexity that makes it all work.

how to finish volumes 1 to 3 :
    
    combine it with the right set of university courses 
    
    discrete math, combinatorics, and number theory, 
    
    it is low-level computer science.

Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. 
In the first five years, according to Bill Gates' own claims, 
he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, 
and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit

Gates was an active software developer,

"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."

"some early habits I had in terms of liking to read lots and lots of books"
liking to have a broad set of curiosities, so not just about computers but 
also about the fields that touch on it, enjoying hiring in smart people 
and working with them, being competitive, thinking


In the first five years I didn't let any line of code get out 
of the company that I hadn't reviewed, and most people's code 
I didn't like as well as mine, so I'd mostly just rewrite it. 
And I knew it all by heart and I didn't waste bytes.
Now I don't get to review the code, and not only do we waste bytes, we waste megabytes.

It's important, when you want to get a sense of what's hard, what's easy, 
to actually have a sense of how the hardware works, 
particularly as we're getting new architectures that 
force us to understand parallelization in a deeper fashion.

Applications will be written at a very abstract level.


You know, when somebody comes to Microsoft we typically say to them, 
OK, what's the most complex piece of software you've worked on, 
whatever it is, get a sense of were they interested in the different 
choices that were available there and as 
they evolved over time did they see new ways that that could be done

And so I'd put a strong emphasis on the basic theory of algorithms 
and how those things go on, but with at least one area that you get by hands on.

If you really want to push the state of the art, say, okay, 
how will vision advance, how will algorithms advance, 
you should even do a little bit of machine type coding, 
driver type coding, and not have those abstractions hidden.

So for people who want to do Microsoft level software and have a 
full understanding of the software stack, yes, the low level stuff 
should be part of your involvement. 

For a lot of people who go out and simply do business applications, 
that will become less important, eventually to the point where they won't really understand it at all.

so if you want to work for Microsoft you have to do some of that low-level –
