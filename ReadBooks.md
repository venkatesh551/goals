# Stop-making-excuses-and-start-building-today
---------------------------------------------

procrastinating = delay or postpone action; put off doing something.

Patience is a virtue

They built the world around them through hard work, persistence and belief in themselves.


"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."  - Theodore Roosevelt
 Read voraciously, never made excuses


# Those who live now and are in the present are always most likely to succeed.
# Their built in advantage is simple: they live in the moment and they maximize the value of their time.
# The most important part of productivity is focusing with maximum energy, attention and efficiency on what you have in front of you in that moment.
# Make no mistake, everything else begins right there.


"Create the highest, grandest vision possible for your life,
because you become what you believe"

"Values are to our foundation"


Values, when chosen properly, are of immeasurable meaning to your life and all of whom you encounter. They form the backbone for a constantly self-improving mindset which will only sharpen with time, of course when you put your wisely chosen values into practice.


"You are never too old to reinvent yourself." -  Steve Harvey



"Alone, when no one else is watching, our character is revealed to us.
We come to understand that excuses aren’t worth it. 
In solitude, we have the ability to think in an innovative way 
about what we want. 
From these dreams and thoughts comes desire, which we then back with faith and begin in earnest to achieve"

# We are given runway in life. That runway is called, time. We can choose to use this time wisely or we can fritter it away.

Fear takes away productive time and turns it into laziness.
