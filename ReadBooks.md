If you behave like a poor-person, you are always poor. Poor folks have poor-ways.

You cannot change outer-world until you chnage your inner-world

Accept complete responsibility for your Life. Take Ownership for results.
Refuse to blame any one.
If something goes wrong, focus on the solution rather than the problem or person.
What do we do from here, what is the next step, what is the solution, what action should I take,
Then you became yourself up and carryon.
Extract the lessons from the situation and then in your way the chain.
The things that happend cannot be changed.

Move out of your comfort zone. You can only grow if you are willing to 
feel awkward and uncomfortable when you try something new.
