Iterative Performance Rating
        
# 

Never hurried. pace was deliberate (slowly and carefully) and actions well thought-out

An assertive and polite way of expressing disapproval becomes necessary in some cases.

Does this situation demand my investment of time and energy ? or Should I let ot go ?

A reaction, on the other hand evokes stress in both parties, leads to actions we may regret
and ends up draining our energy which could have, otherwise been spent productively.
Such reactions are mostly driven by emotions.

Be relaxed and be deliberate and slow.
