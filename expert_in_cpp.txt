Read book and solve questions from 
The C Programming Language
Book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.
After that write code on any online coding contest website.


For C++ :

First read book  Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++  Book by Bjarne Stroustrup then

skill acquisition :
-------------------

The original model proposes that a student passes through five distinct stages: novice, competence, proficiency, expertise, and mastery.


In the novice stage, a person follows rules as given, without context, with no sense of responsibility beyond following the rules exactly. 

Competence develops when the individual develops organizing principles to quickly access the particular rules that are relevant to the specific task at hand; hence, competence is characterized by active decision making in choosing a course of action. 

Proficiency is shown by individuals who develop intuition to guide their decisions and devise their own rules to formulate plans. 

The progression is thus from rigid adherence to rules to an intuitive mode of reasoning based on tacit knowledge.

Michael Eraut summarized the five stages of increasing skill as follows:[2]

1. Novice
"rigid adherence to taught rules or plans"
no exercise of "discretionary judgment"

2. Advanced beginner
limited "situational perception"
all aspects of work treated separately with equal importance

3. Competent
"coping with crowdedness" (multiple activities, accumulation of information)
some perception of actions in relation to goals
deliberate planning
formulates routines

4. Proficient
holistic view of situation
prioritizes importance of aspects
"perceives deviations from the normal pattern"
employs maxims for guidance, with meanings that adapt to the situation at hand

5. Expert
transcends reliance on rules, guidelines, and maxims
"intuitive grasp of situations based on deep, tacit understanding"
has "vision of what is possible"
uses "analytical approaches" in new situations or in case of problems






















Type inference :
------------------

ability to automatically deduce, either partially or fully, the type of an expression at compile time.
    


Template (C++)
-------------

Templates allows functions and classes to operate with generic types. 

There are three kinds of templates:
    
    function templates, 
    class templates and, 
    variable templates (since C++14)


Function templates :
--------------------
    syntax for declaring function templates with type parameters is:

        template <class identifier> function_declaration;
        template <typename identifier> function_declaration;

Both expressions have the same meaning and behave in exactly the same way.
The latter form was introduced to avoid confusion,
since a type parameter need not be a class. (It can also be a basic type)

The composition offered by templates is type-safe.
    
max example

templates are introduced with the primary focus on techniques needed for the design,
implementation, and use of the standard library

Every major standard-library abstraction is represented as a template 
(for example, string, ostream , regex , complex , list , map , 
unique_ptr , thread , future , tuple , and function)

Class templates :
-----------------

A class template provides a specification for generating classes based on parameters.


Variable templates : (since C++14)
-------------------


Template specialization:
---------------------------    
When a function or class is instantiated from a template, 
a specialization of that template is created by the compiler 
for the set of arguments used,


Variadic templates
--------------------
C++11 introduced variadic templates, which can take a variable 
number of arguments in a manner somewhat similar to variadic 
functions such as std::printf. 
Both function templates and class templates can be variadic.


Drawbacks to the use of templates: 
-----------------------------------
1. Many compilers lack clear instructions when they detect a template definition error.
2. It can be difficult to debug code that is developed using templates



In the standard library, string is a synonym for basic_string<char>

using string = std::basic_string<char>;
