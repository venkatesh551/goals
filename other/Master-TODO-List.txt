Einstein used 3 simple principles to be productive:

He had a daily ritual and schedule.
He lived a minimalist lifestyle.
He focused on his most important work


The minimalist luxury lifestyle is:

owning fewer things
owning things of good quality
valuing our possessions and freeing our time for other pursuits
de-cluttering our lives to free our mental space


He focused on the task at hand and worked until it was complete.
He worked in almost total isolation.
ability and willingness to concentrate on one important task and work on the task to completion.

Knuth’s full-time writing schedule means that he is ‘pretty much a hermit… concentrating intensively and uninterruptedly on one subject at a time, rather than swapping a number of topics in and out of his head. I’m unable to schedule appointments with visitors, travel to conferences or accept speaking engagements, or undertake any new responsibilities of any kind.’
